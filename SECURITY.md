## Security Policy

### Reporting a Vulnerability

We appreciate your help in identifying security issues. Given that this is a proof of concept project, our timelines for addressing reported issues are on a "best effort" basis. Hereâ€™s how you can report a security vulnerability:

1. **Private GitHub Issues:** Please use the [GitHub private issues feature](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository) to report the vulnerability.
2. **Email:** Alternatively, you can email me directly at [jack@latrobe.group](mailto:jack@latrobe.group).

Please provide as much information as possible, including any exploit code, to help me understand the scope and severity of the issue.

### Security Process

Upon receiving a report, I'll work to understand, reproduce, and address the issue based on its severity and my availability. Your understanding and patience are appreciated.
